# Daedalus Flight Control Software
This application is a flight control system meant to run on our Arduino-based flight computer.
The purpose of the flight computer is to collect sensor data and control the descent of a CanSat that our team is working on.

Due to time constraints, comments, code cleanliness and documention are somewhat lacking.
